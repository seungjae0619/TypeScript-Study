# TypeScript & React Study

This is my repository for TypeScript study & Tailwind CSS by using '우아한 타입스크립트 with 리액트'

## 📚 About This Project

This personal blog project documents my journey learning TypeScript with React. Based on the book '우아한 타입스크립트 with 리액트', I'm building a web application that showcases TypeScript concepts chapter by chapter while implementing modern UI with Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next generation frontend tooling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

## 📖 Content Structure

The blog is organized by chapters, each focusing on specific TypeScript concepts:

- Chapter 1: TypeScript Basics
- Chapter 2: Types and Interfaces
- (More chapters will be added as I progress through the book)
